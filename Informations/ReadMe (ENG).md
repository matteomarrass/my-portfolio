# My Portfolio (ENG)

Hi there, that's my resume, where I collect my personal experiences (professionals and not), skills and passions!
It will be used to propose me in job interviews to obtain an internship to start my carreer!
It will be divided in 4 sections:
* Basic panoramic: short description about myself. There you can find my skills, informations about me and my passions in a brief and simple way.
* Job Experiences
* Study Experience
* Projects: here you can find my lasts project, even this resume!!
### Here the technologies that I used:
* HTML
* CSS with preprocessor SASS
* Javascript
* React (with React Router library to create Web App)
### How to start the project
Start it as every React project so, with npm start!
### Come funziona
At the start you will be redirected to a Selection Language page. If you clicked in the 'Inglese' voice and the page it gives you an error, don't worry, I didn't developed it for now.
I put an Error404 page to replace the missing one!
Clicking on 'Italiano' you can enter in the main page, you can navigate with the Navbar or if you go at the end of the page, under the Skills and Passions part, you can switch easily between pages!
### Credits
